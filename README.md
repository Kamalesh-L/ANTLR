# ANTLR Lexer and Parser Tree Examples

Welcome to the **ANTLR Lexer and Parser Tree Examples** repository! This repository contains examples and exercises I studied during my Compiler Design course. It showcases the use of ANTLR for lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and generating parse trees for various grammars.



ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator used to create lexer and parser for various languages. This repository focuses on:
- Understanding lexer rules.
- Constructing parser grammars.
- Generating and visualizing parse trees.

These examples are aimed at reinforcing concepts learned in my Compiler Design course.
